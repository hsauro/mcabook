Prerequisites
=============

Certain topics and concepts are assumed to be familiar by the reader or are only given a cursory introduction for the introductory and intermediate sections. These include:

Kinetics
--------

- Basic Chemical Kinetics: Difference between rates of change, reaction rates. Mass-action kinetics, the equilibrium constant.

- Basic Enzyme Kinetics: Irreversible and reversible Michaelis-Menten kinetics for single substrate, single product reactions. Product inhibition, competitive and uncompetitive inhibition.

- Cooperativity, allostery, and the Hill equation.


Biology
-------

- Knowledge of metabolic pathways, the role of enzymes in metabolic pathways, knowledge of allosteric control. Some knowledge of protein signaling networks for more advanced topics.
- Stoichiometric networks, mass-balance equations to formulate metabolic models.
- Concept of the steady state, concentrations and fluxes, boundary and floating species.

Mathematics
-----------

- Elementary differential calculus, understanding partial derivatives and differential equations, logarithms.
- For the advanced section some knowledge of matrices and vectors, matrix addition, multiplication and inversion, knowledge of eigenvalues.
