=====

There are a number of software tools currently available that support most of MCA. That is, given a model the software can compute the elasticities and control coefficients as well as other relate metrics. All the following tools are cross-platform and currently work.

1. `Tellurium <https://github.com/sys-bio/tellurium>`_: Python interface with high performance simulate as a backend.

2. `COPASI <https://copasi.org/>`_: GUI interface with optional Python API

3. `VCell <https://vcell.org/>`_ : GUI Interface

4. `PySCeS <https://pysces.sourceforge.net/>`_: Python Interface

5. `MASSpy <https://github.com/SBRG/MASSpy>`_: Python Interface

6. `SBW <https://sbw.sourceforge.net/>`_: GUI Interface

7. `PyscesToolbox <https://github.com/PySCeS/PyscesToolbox>`_ Unique Python application can than deivate the control equation algebraically.
