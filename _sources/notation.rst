Notation
========

This is an important note on notation:

Following other authors, an upper case letter such as `S` indicates the name of a molecular species
while the lower case italic variant, `s`, indicates the concentration of species `S`. 

This is to avoid the use of square brackets, as in `[S]` which can result in unnecessary clutter in some equations.
